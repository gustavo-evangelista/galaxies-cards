## üé® Design & Layout

### Color Palette

| Element | Color/Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | `#121214` | Main dark background for the body. |
| **Main Heading** | `#02799d` | Cool blue accent color for the main title. |
| **Sub-Heading** | `#e1e1e6` | Light color for the sub-heading and card titles. |
| **Card Background** | `#202024` | Slightly lighter dark background for the content cards. |

| **Card Paragraph Text**| `#c4c4cc` | Light gray color for the description text. |

### Structure & Components

* **Layout:** The entire page is centered on the screen and padded generously (`72px 104px`) to provide focus on the content.
* **Header:** Contains the main title (`h1: The largest galaxies`) and a sub-title (`p: And curiosities about them`).
* **Gallery (`main`):** Uses a **CSS Grid** defined as `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 366px)` to enforce a fixed, visually balanced three-column layout.
* **Cards (`.card`):** Each card has a slightly rounded border (`border-radius: 8px`), a border, and uses `overflow: hidden` to ensure the image fits perfectly within the container's rounded corners.
